# Williams Sonoma Coding Challenge

This is my solution to a coding challenge from Williams Sonoma.

## Data Source

The specified [data feed](https://www.westelm.com/services/catalog/v4/category/shop/new/all-new/index.json) is served without an Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header, so I have cached it on GitHub, which does send the header for JSON files and should thus allow me to load it without Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors.

To enable [deployment](https://bdsexton.github.io/williams-sonoma-coding-challenge/_assets/data/products.json) via GitHub Pages there is a copy of the data feed file in both the <code>source</code> directory and the <code>docs</code> directory.

* [source/_assets/data/products.json](https://github.com/bdsexton/williams-sonoma-coding-challenge/blob/master/source/_assets/data/products.json)
* [docs/_assets/data/products.json](https://github.com/bdsexton/williams-sonoma-coding-challenge/blob/master/docs/_assets/data/products.json)

## Resources

I may not use all of these in the final version of my challenge solution, but I want to keep track of third-party resources I've considered and used during development.
