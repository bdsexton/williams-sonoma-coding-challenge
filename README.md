# Williams Sonoma Coding Challenge

This is my solution to a coding challenge from Williams Sonoma.

## Data Source

The specified [data feed](https://www.westelm.com/services/catalog/v4/category/shop/new/all-new/index.json) is served without an Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header, so I'm caching a copy of it on GitHub, which supposedly does send the header for JSON files and should thus allow me to load it without Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors.

## Resources

I may not use all of these in the final version of my challenge solution, but I want to keep track of third-party resources I've considered and used during development.
